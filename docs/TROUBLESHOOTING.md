# Troubleshooting

If none of these match, open a [bug report](https://github.com/rphang/opencode-workflows/issues/new/choose)
and include the run's `run.json` and `journal.jsonl`. They are in the run's transcript directory,
`<data dir>/<sessionID>/<runId>/`, which is `transcriptDir` in the tool output.

## Installing and loading

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The model says it has no `workflow` tool | The plugin didn't load. Run `opencode plugin list`, or check `GET /api/plugin` on `opencode serve` for `dynamic-workflows`. The config key must be `plugins` (plural); the legacy `plugin` key loads nothing and gives no error. Check that `OPENCODE_DISABLE_WORKFLOWS` is not set and that the `disabled` option isn't `true`. |
| `Duplicate plugin ID: dynamic-workflows` | The plugin is loaded twice, for example the npm package and a loader file. Keep one method ([INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)). |
| `opencode plugin list` or `plugin add` times out waiting for the background service to start | The CLI's plugin commands go through a managed background service on port 49374. Another opencode process already holds that port. Stop it, or run `opencode service set port <port>`. The reason is logged in `opencode/log/opencode.log` under opencode's data directory. |
| `opencode plugin list` prints `No plugins found` right after an install | The first command started the service and the plugin is still loading. Run it again after a few seconds. |
| `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename '...opencode-workflows@<spec>\.staging-...'` during `plugin add` (Windows) | A transient file lock (often antivirus) in opencode's npm cache. The config was not changed. Run the same command again. |
| A new config entry is not picked up | Wait about 20 s (opencode downloads the package), then run `opencode service restart` or restart the TUI. |
| `configured plugin path must be a directory` | A from-source `file://` entry must point at the repo directory, not at a file ([INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#directory-entry-in-the-config)). |
| A from-source loader file never activates | It must be a static `export { default } from "<abs path>"`. A top-level `await import()` never activates. For `src/index.ts`, run `npm install` in the repo; for `dist/index.js`, run `npm run build`. |

## Runs and notifications

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The run never reports back | You used `opencode run --standalone`. Its private server exits as soon as the turn ends, and that kills the background run. Use the TUI, or a long-lived `opencode serve` with `opencode run --server <url>`. `/workflows` then shows the run as `stopped` (interrupted). Relaunch it with `resumeFromRunId`. |
| `opencode run` (without `--standalone`) exits before the answer | Expected. The run continues in the background service, and the notification and the final answer land in the session there. Read them in the TUI, or with `opencode run -c` or `opencode run -s <sessionID>`. |
| `opencode run "/workflows"` doesn't show the view | Slash commands run from the TUI or web UI; `opencode run` sends the text as a normal message. With `opencode serve`, call `POST /api/session/<sessionID>/command` with `{"name":"workflows","text":""}` and the `x-opencode-directory` header, then send another message. In Git Bash on Windows, MSYS rewrites arguments that start with `/`; set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. |
| The notification arrives late | Notifications are queued after your current turn and never injected mid-turn. `/workflows` output also waits for your next turn. |
| The run stopped with "the workflow plugin was unloaded" | opencode disposed the plugin (shutdown, a plugin update, or the location going idle for 60 minutes). The notification includes a `resumeFromRunId` hint. Relaunch with it. |
| `nothing to resume` | The run id is unknown, belongs to another session, or has no finished agents. |
| The model keeps calling `workflow_control status` instead of waiting | Status never includes the result, by design (P77), and from the second call it says repeating does not help. `result` gives the same note while the run is going. Tell the model to end its turn. The notification wakes the session when the run finishes. |
| The result is empty, `null` or odd | Read the notification's `<agent-failures>` block: it names the agents that returned nothing, with their error. Ask the model what the agents returned: it uses `workflow_control` `{action:"result", runId}` (failed agents first) and `agent:"<index or label>"` for one agent's full value (X21). `/workflows <runId>` shows the same agents to you. |
| The run failed and `<agent-failures>` says "No agent failed" | The script itself threw the error in `<result>`, not an agent. That includes an `agent()` call refused before the agent started (spent `budget`, the 1000-agent cap, an invalid schema or options): uncaught, it fails the run with that error. Fix the script or the option the error names. |
| The result has unexplained `null`s and there is no `<agent-failures>` block | Every recorded agent returned a value, so there is nothing to list. An `agent()` call refused before the agent started (same causes as above) inside `parallel()`/`pipeline()` becomes a `null` and leaves no agent record, so no block names it. `workflow_control` `result` then lists fewer agents than the script made `agent()` calls. Check `budget`, the agent count and the options. |
| opencode asks for `external_directory` access to the workflows data dir | The model tried to read run files (`journal.jsonl`, `agents/<i>.json`). It does not need to: `workflow_control` `result` shows the same data. Deny the prompt, or add a `deny` rule for the data dir. |
| A headless `opencode serve` turn hangs after the notification | A permission prompt is waiting and no client is attached to answer it. The usual one is an `external_directory` read of the data dir by the model. Answer it (`POST /api/session/<id>/permission/<requestId>/reply`) or add a rule for the data dir. |
| The model relaunched a failed run without being asked | Model habit, seen with small free models. The notification says to retry only when you ask. Tell the model not to relaunch, and stop the new run if you don't want it. |
| The notification is huge | The `<result>` is the script's whole return value and is not clipped. Return a summary; the model can fetch each agent's full value with `workflow_control` `result`. |

## Agents

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| An agent fails with "workflow agents cannot ask for approval" | It is unlinked, worktree-isolated, or configured with `permissionMode: "deny"`. Add an `allow` rule for the specific tool or directory, or use a non-worktree agent with `permissionMode: "prompt"` and an attached client. |
| An agent seems stuck | Check the parent session for a native permission prompt. For unattended agents, set `OPENCODE_WORKFLOW_PERMISSION_MODE=deny`. You can also set `OPENCODE_WORKFLOW_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS`, or ask the model to `stop_agent` it (that `agent()` returns `null`). |
| A schema agent throws after several attempts | Its output didn't match the schema `MAX_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_RETRIES` times (default 5). Simplify the schema, raise the limit, or use a stronger model for that agent. |
| `effort` has no effect, with a warning | The model has no variant for that effort level. The option is ignored. |
| A schema agent in a worktree returns loosely parsed JSON, or its approval requests hang | The plugin isn't loaded in the worktree. Install it globally, or commit the project config ([INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#why-global)). |
| An `agentType` agent returns `null` right away | The id is unknown, is a primary agent (such as `build` or `plan`), or your `subagent` permission denies it. |
| Leftover `wf-<runId>-<i>` worktrees after a crash | They are not removed automatically, because another process might still own the run. Once you know the run is dead, remove them with `git worktree remove`. |

## Scripts

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `export const meta must be the first statement` or a meta error | `meta` must come first and be a pure literal: no variables, calls, spreads or template interpolation. |
| A syntax error on a type annotation | Scripts are plain JavaScript, not TypeScript. |
| `Date.now() is not available in workflow scripts` (or `Math.random()`, or `new Date()`) | These would break resume. Pass timestamps in through `args`, and vary prompts by index instead of randomness. |
| `scriptPath ... is outside the project directory` or `... is denied by opencode's read permission` | The file is outside the allowed locations (see the [security model](../README.md#security-model)). Add an `external_directory` allow rule for its directory, copy the script into the project, or pass it inline. |
| A saved workflow doesn't show up as `/<name>` | Its `meta` is not a pure literal, so it is not registered. Check the file in `.opencode/workflows/` or `~/.config/opencode/workflows/`. |

## `/deep-research`

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| It stops early with `NO_WEB_ACCESS`, or its web calls hang for about 60 s | `websearch` needs a provider. The first call asks you to choose one, and a workflow agent cannot answer that prompt. Run one web search in your own session first. |
| Claims are listed as UNVERIFIED | The skeptics could not check them (errors, rate limits or failing web tools). A tool failure counts as an abstention, never as a refutation. Fix web access and rerun. |
