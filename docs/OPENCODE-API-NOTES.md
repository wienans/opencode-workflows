# OpenCode plugin API notes for the workflow runner

## 2.0.29 linked sessions and approval

- `ctx.session.create({parentID, ...})` creates a linked child at its parent's location. The
  workflow runner uses this for non-worktree agents. Supplying a worktree location instead keeps
  the agent unlinked, because linked children inherit the parent's location.
- Linked children's permission requests remain owned by the child and are collected by the native
  parent session UI. The workflow permission hook leaves their `ask` decisions untouched by default.
  It still denies asks for unlinked agents and for `permissionMode: "deny"` runs.
- `ctx.permission.assert` is available for plugin-owned operations. This change does not use it
  to proxy child approvals, and `scriptPath` admission still uses the existing non-interactive checks.
- `tests/e2e/permissions.test.ts` verifies native session linking and the server-side request/reply
  lifecycle without model calls, including configured denials after an always-allow reply.
  The runner and guard are covered through the real plugin in `tests/parity/subagents.test.ts`.
  Interactive TUI rendering has not been rechecked.

## Historical 2.0.15 observations

The remaining sections were observed live on opencode **2.0.15** (`npx opencode2 run --standalone`) using
the throwaway plugins in `tests/e2e/spikes/` (`explore.js`, `runner-live.ts`), unless it is marked
*(source)*, which means it was read from the v2 branch of `anomalyco/opencode` (`packages/core/src`).
The fake in `tests/helpers/fake-opencode-ctx.ts` mirrors these shapes.

## Session API (`ctx.session`)

- `create({title?, metadata?, agent?, model?, permissions?, location?, id?})` returns the
  Session.Info object:
  ```json
  {"id":"ses_…","projectID":"c5e10c0c9e…","model":{"id":"gpt-5.4-mini","providerID":"openai","variant":"default"},
   "cost":0,"tokens":{"input":0,"output":0,"reasoning":0,"cache":{"read":0,"write":0}},
   "time":{"created":…,"updated":…},"title":"[wf:live1] plain",
   "metadata":{"workflowRunId":"live1","workflowAgentIndex":0,"parentSessionID":"ses_…"},
   "permissions":[{"action":"workflow","resource":"*","effect":"deny"}, …],
   "location":{"directory":"C:\\…\\rproj"}}
  ```
  - `model` is `{providerID, id, variant?}`. If you omit it, the child does **not** inherit the
    parent's model. It gets opencode's default (a free `opencode/*` model), and `get()` shows no
    `model` field. So the runner always passes the parent's model explicitly (P25).
  - A `variant` is stored as given, e.g. `{…, "variant":"high"}`. When no variant is given, opencode
    fills in `"default"`.
  - On 2.0.15, the plugin `create` had no `parentID` *(source: plugin/host.ts)*. The default `location` is the
    plugin's own location.
  - `metadata` and `permissions` are stored verbatim and returned by `get()`.
- `prompt({sessionID, text})` returns immediately with
  `{id, sessionID, time, type:"user", payload:{text}, delivery:"steer"}`.
- `wait({sessionID})` resolves with `undefined` once the session is idle.
- `get({sessionID})` returns Session.Info with cumulative `tokens`, `cost` (USD), and
  `outcome: "succeeded" | "failed" | "interrupted"`, plus `time.idle`.
- `context({sessionID})` returns an array of messages:
  - `{type:"user", text}`
  - `{type:"assistant", agent, model, content:[{type:"reasoning",…}|{type:"text",text}|{type:"tool", name, state:{status, input, content:[{type:"text",text}]}}], finish, cost, tokens, error?}`
  - `{type:"idle", outcome}`
- `interrupt({sessionID})` returns `{interrupted:true}`. The following `wait()` resolves and `get()`
  reports `outcome:"interrupted"`. **The tokens and cost of an interrupted turn are not counted**:
  `get()` showed 0 for all of them after interrupting a turn that had streamed for about 2.5
  seconds. As a result, stopped agents report whatever usage had been recorded before the stop.
- `synthetic({sessionID, text, description?, metadata?, delivery?, resume?})` puts an item in the
  session inbox and returns within a few ms with `{id, sessionID, type:"synthetic", delivery, …}`.
  See "Inbox and steering" below.
- `interrupt({sessionID, resume:true})` ends the current step and lets the session carry on with a
  successor execution that reads the inbox (verified live; used by urgent steering, X08). On an
  **idle** session it interrupts nothing (`{interrupted:false}`) but still starts an execution when
  a steer item is pending, and does nothing when none is (`execution.interrupt` →
  `SessionInbox.nextPromotable` → `wake`; the server API documents it as "resumes pending steering
  input"). Verified live in e2e `steer.test.ts` ("X03 opencode: …"). The runner uses this to deliver
  a steer that missed the turn.
- `wait()` is `execution.awaitIdle`: after an execution settles it checks again, so it also covers a
  successor execution started at settle or by a wake that happened before `wait()` was called.
- **Terminal failure** (tested with an unknown model `openai/no-such-model-xyz`): `wait()` resolves
  within milliseconds and `get().outcome` is `"failed"`. `context()` contains **only**
  `[user, {type:"idle", outcome:"failed"}]`, with no assistant message and no error text. When an
  assistant message does exist, `error: {type, message, status?}` is set on it *(types)*. The
  runner reports that message, or a generic "agent session failed (terminal error)".

## Inbox and steering (X01–X08)

Verified live on 2.0.15 with a throwaway spike plugin (children on `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` calling a
3-second tool), and in `packages/core/src/session/{inbox,execution,run-coordinator}.ts` and
`runner/llm.ts` *(source)*:

- **`delivery:"steer"` items are promoted before every model step.** The drain loop in
  `runner/llm.ts` checks the inbox before each step, so a steer sent mid-turn becomes a user-role
  context message `{id, type:"synthetic", text, description?, metadata?}` at the next step
  boundary of the **same** execution: one execution, `wait()` resolves once, outcome
  `succeeded`. It is not read mid-step: the step in progress and all its tool calls finish first.
- **The returned `id` is the id of that context message**, so "was it delivered?" is
  `context().some(m => m.id === res.id)`. Its `time.created` is the delivery time.
- **`resume:false` can orphan a message.** A steer that lands after the drain loop's last check
  (as the final step starts), or while the session is idle, stays in the inbox and is never read
  (3 out of 3 live attempts). `resume:true` behaves the same mid-turn, and at the end of a turn
  wakes the session into a successor execution that reads it. `wait()` follows successor
  executions, but one started after `wait()` resolved is only seen by a later `wait()`. In the
  e2e runs (`tests/e2e/steer.test.ts`), messages sent up to 0.8 s after a child's last tool call
  returned were still read in the same execution: when a step finishes with items in the inbox,
  opencode takes another step.
- **Worktree children** (another Location) receive steers sent by the parent Location's plugin
  instance: `synthetic()` addresses the session by id (verified live).
- **`delivery:"queue"` runs as an extra turn after the current one**, and its reply becomes the
  last assistant message: for a workflow agent it would replace the result. The plugin never uses
  it for steering (only for the parent's task notification, P06).
- **`interrupt({resume:true})`** gives `execution.interrupted{reason:"user"}`, then a new execution
  that reads the inbox; `get().outcome` ends `succeeded`. The interrupted step's tokens are lost
  from the session usage, and the history gets an `{type:"idle", outcome:"interrupted"}` marker.
- The plugin API cannot list or cancel inbox items (`DELETE /api/session/:id/inbox/:inboxID` exists
  over HTTP only). opencode's session view does not render synthetic messages, so a steering
  message is visible in `/workflows <runId>` and `agents/<i>.json`, not in the child's transcript
  view (it is in the child's `context()`).

- **A parked steer is promoted in a step of its own, before queued items.** `promote()` publishes
  every pending steer and returns; a queued item is promoted at the next boundary. So a session
  with a parked `resume:false` steer (for example `/workflows` output) and a queued `resume:true`
  item (the task notification) runs two model steps when it wakes: one answering the steer, one
  the queued item. Reproduced live in e2e `steer.test.ts`.

How the runner uses this (design: `docs/design/steering-and-live-tree.md` §A.4): a message is sent
with `synthetic({delivery:"steer", resume:false})` only while the agent's turn runs, so it never
wakes the child by itself. When `wait()` resolves the runner stops accepting messages for that turn
and checks every sent id in `context()`. If one is missing (it arrived after the turn's last step
boundary and is parked), the runner calls `interrupt({resume:true})`, which starts the successor
turn that reads it, and checks again with a short backoff (about 2 s) before it reads the result,
then waits once more so the reply to a late message is complete. A message still missing then is
reported `undelivered` and stays parked: no turn ever runs after the result was read. A send whose
`synthetic()` returned no id gets the same wake and one short extra wait, and stays `sent`.
Messages for an agent that has no session yet are appended to its first prompt instead. (Before
0.2, messages went out with `resume:true`, which could start a successor turn after the runner
had given up verifying: that turn ran unread and its tokens were never counted.)

## RPC, events and TUI plugins (X11–X16)

Verified live on 2.0.15: a throwaway spike (local `.tsx` TUI plugin) and the packaged plugin
installed from a local registry into an isolated sandbox (design: `docs/design/steering-and-live-tree.md`).

- **`ctx.rpc.register(definition, handlers)`** resolves `{events: {emit(name, data)}, dispose()}`.
  `definition` is plain data: `{id, methods: {name: {input, output}}, events: {name: {schema}}}` with
  JSON Schema values. Handlers must return JSON (`rpc.invalid_output "Expected JSON value"`
  otherwise); an input that fails its schema is rejected before the handler runs
  (`rpc.invalid_input`).
- **Over HTTP:** `POST /api/rpc/<id>/<method>` with header `x-opencode-directory: <url-encoded dir>`
  and the body **`{"input": {...}}`**; the reply is `{"output": {...}}`. A bare `{...}` body gives
  `{"_tag":"RpcError","type":"rpc.invalid_input","message":"Expected object"}`. The call goes to the
  plugin instance of that Location (booting it if needed).
- **RPC events** are published on the one global `/api/event` stream as `rpc.<id>.<name>`, with the
  emitting instance's `location.directory`. A TUI receives the events of every Location (the spike saw
  a worktree Location's events), so the client filters them itself. Calls are routed per Location;
  events are not.
- **`ctx.event.subscribe({signal})`** is an async iterable of every event. Child-session events used
  by the activity overlay: `session.step.started {model:{id, providerID}}`,
  `session.tool.input.started {id, name}`, `session.tool.called {id, input}` (no `name`: map it from
  the `id`), `session.text.started|delta {delta}|ended {text}`, `session.reasoning.*`,
  `session.usage.updated {cost, tokens}` (cumulative), `session.inbox.delivered`.
- **TUI entry.** `Host.resolve` returns `{server, tui, rpc}`: for a package it resolves
  `<name>/tui` through `exports`, for a directory `<dir>/tui`. When a TUI entry exists the server
  reports `features.tui` and the TUI imports it. The TUI swaps in its own `solid-js`, `solid-js/store`,
  `@opentui/*` and `@opencode/plugin/tui` for plugin modules, **including ESM files under
  `node_modules`** (`"type": "module"`), but it **JSX-compiles only local files**. So the published
  `dist/tui.js` is precompiled with `@opentui/solid`'s Babel transform (Solid universal mode) and
  keeps those modules external. Verified: installed as `@rphang/opencode-workflows@0.2.0-live.2` from
  a local registry, it loaded (`features:{server:true,tui:true}`) and rendered the footer and panel.
- **TUI API used:** `ui.slot({append:"prompt.footer.status" | "home.footer.status" | "session.panel" |
  "app"})`; `ui.panel.open(name)` works on a session route only and gives the panel focus;
  `<leader>left`/`<leader>right` move focus between session and panel. A `keymap.layer` created in
  the panel's render with `enabled: () => input.focused` receives plain keys (`up,k`, `return`, `x`,
  `shift+m`, `escape`). `ui.tabs.focus(childSessionID)` opens a workflow child in a new tab.
  `ui.dialog.confirm`/`prompt`/`select` and `ui.toast.show` work from a keymap command.
- **`attention.notify`** returns `{ok, notification, sound, skipped?}`: `skipped:"attention_disabled"`
  unless `cli.json` sets `attention.notifications` (or `.sound`), and `"focus_unknown"` in Windows
  conhost, which does not report focus. The plugin then shows a toast (seen live).
- **Windows conhost draws emoji-capable symbols (✉ ⚙ ✎) two cells wide** while opentui counts one, so
  the rest of the line shifts and characters get overwritten. The tree uses narrow glyphs only
  (● ✓ ✗ ◌ » and box-drawing).

## Permissions (P60/P61)

- A rule has the shape `{action, resource, effect: "allow"|"deny"|"ask"}`. For tools, `action` is
  the tool name (or `tool.options.permission`, if set).
- Effective rules are the agent's rules followed by the session's `permissions`. Evaluation uses
  `findLast`, so **later rules win** *(source: permission.ts)*.
- A tool whose last matching rule is `{resource:"*", effect:"deny"}` is **removed from the tool
  list** *(source: tool.ts `whollyDisabled`)*. **Verified live** with a `session.hook("context")`
  that logs `Object.keys(input.tools)`:
  - The parent session sees `…,workflow,workflow_submit`.
  - A child with `[{action:"workflow",resource:"*",effect:"deny"}, {action:"workflow_submit",…,"deny"}]`
    sees neither tool.
  - A schema child with `…workflow_submit allow` sees `workflow_submit` but not `workflow`.
- Parent sessions created by `opencode run` have **no** session-level `permissions` field (it is
  undefined), so there is usually nothing to copy. Restrictions such as Plan mode live in the
  **agent's** rules (`plugin/plan.ts` pushes `edit * deny` onto `plan`), so the runner creates the
  child with the parent's current agent (tool `ctx.agent`, else `Session.Info.agent`); with a
  different `agentType` it appends the parent agent's deny/ask rules to the child's session rules.
- `ctx.agent.get({agentID})` returns `{location, data: Agent.Info}` (`data.mode`:
  `"subagent"|"primary"|"all"`, `data.permissions`) and rejects with `Agent not found: <id>`.
  opencode's subagent tool refuses `mode === "primary"` and asserts `{action:"subagent",
  resource:<agent id>}` *(source: tool/plugin/subagent.ts)*; the runner mirrors both checks.
- File reads are gated by `external_directory` (resource `<dir>/*`, for paths outside the location
  and project directories) then `read` (resource: path relative to the location, or the absolute
  path) *(source: file-access.ts)*. Default agents allow `external_directory` for opencode's tmp,
  config and tool-output dirs; unmatched → `ask`. `scriptPath` checks mirror this (P76).

- **Asks and forms in children are never seen** *(source + live probe)*. The TUI shows (and
  auto-accepts) permission requests and question forms only for the viewed session and its
  `parentID` family; `opencode run --auto` answers only its own session. Plugin children have no
  parentID, so a child's "ask" (default agents ask for `external_directory` and `*.env` reads) or a
  `question` call waits forever. Fix (P63): children get `question` denied, and
  `ctx.permission.hook("evaluate", e => …)` rewrites `e.effect` "ask" → "deny" (plus `e.message`)
  for sessions whose metadata has `workflowRunId`. The hook sees the effect after saved "always"
  approvals *(source: permission.ts `evaluateInput`)*. Both the permission service and the hook
  registry are **per location**, so only the plugin instance loaded for the child's location sees
  its evaluations, and `ctx.permission.list({sessionID})` only lists requests in that location.

## Plugin lifetime *(source)*

- A plugin instance is scoped to its location. Its cleanup runs on shutdown, and also on a live
  server when `Plugin.activate` closes every plugin after the first definition whose (id, revision)
  changed (adding or updating a plugin that sorts earlier, a pending npm install finishing), and
  when `LocationActivity` evicts a location after 60 minutes without durable session events there
  (it interrupts that location's active sessions, then `locations.invalidate`).
- `ctx.session.update({sessionID, title})` publishes a durable `Session.Renamed` event even when the
  title is unchanged; that event carries the session's location and refreshes its idle timer. The
  host uses it as a keep-alive for the parent while a run is active (every 20 min). Title
  generation compares title values, so a same-title rename does not block it.

## Tools

- `ctx.tool.transform(e => e.add({name, description, input: <JSON Schema>, options:{codemode:false}, execute}))`.
  `execute(input, tctx)` returns `{content: string | [{type:"text",text}], output?, metadata?}`.
  Returned content is shown to the model as the tool result, as the retry trace below shows.
- **Tools are registered per location (plugin instance).** A session whose `location` is another
  directory, such as a worktree, only sees the tools of the plugin instance loaded for that
  directory. In `explore.js` the plugin lived in an uncommitted `.opencode/`, the worktree did not
  have it, and the child could not find the tool. Consequences:
  - For worktree agents with a schema, the plugin must also load in the worktree. Either install it
    globally (`~/.config/opencode`), or ship it in a committed `.opencode/`.
  - The `workflow_submit` call is then handled by the worktree's instance. For that reason the
    submit registry mirrors its state to `ctx.storage`.
- **`ctx.storage` is shared across plugin instances.** It is backed by one global KV with the
  namespace `plugin:<hex(pluginID)>:` *(source: plugin/host.ts `storage`)*. **Verified live**: in
  `wtschema`, a schema agent inside a worktree submitted through the worktree instance's tool, and
  the runner in the parent instance read the accepted value. The `workflow-submit/<sessionID>` keys
  were gone from the `kv` table afterwards.

## Structured output: live retry trace

Schema `{code: {type:"string", pattern:"^ZX-[0-9]{4}$"}}`, prompt "submit 'abc'":
```
workflow_submit {"output":{"code":"abc"}}     -> "Output failed schema validation:\n/code: must match pattern \"^ZX-[0-9]{4}$\"\nFix the output and call workflow_submit again."
workflow_submit {"output":{"code":"ZX-0000"}} -> "Output accepted. …"
```
The runner returned `{status:"completed", value:{code:"ZX-0000"}}` with a single prompt. The model
retried inside the same turn.

## Models (P25/P26)

- `ctx.model.list()` returns `{location, data: ModelInfo[]}`. Each entry is
  `ModelInfo = {id, modelID, providerID, name, variants:[{id,…}], enabled, time:{released}, …}`.
  In this run it listed 62 models. Observed variants:
  - `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`: `none, low, medium, high, xhigh`
  - `openai/gpt-5`: `minimal, low, medium, high`
  - `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free`: none
  - `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`: `minimal … xhigh`
- `ModelInfo.id` can differ from `modelID`. For example, `gpt-5.4-mini-fast` has
  `modelID: gpt-5.4-mini`. The session model ref uses `id`.
- **Verified live**: `effort:"high"` on the default model `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` produced a child
  whose `get().model` is `{…,"variant":"high"}`.

## Worktrees (P28)

- `ctx.worktree.create({projectID, name?, directory?, from?, branch?})` returns `{directory}`.
  `projectID` is `parent.projectID`, which equals `ctx.location.project.id`. The directory defaults
  to `<XDG_DATA_HOME>/opencode/worktree/<projectID[0:6]>/<name>` *(source: worktree/strategies.ts)*.
  A git project is required (in a non-git directory the project id is `"global"`). `branch` is a
  starting ref, not a new branch name.
- A session created with `location:{directory: worktree}` runs inside that directory, and opencode
  loads (activates) the plugins for that location (`setup` ran again with the worktree directory).
- `ctx.worktree.remove({projectID, directory, force:false})` returns `undefined` and deletes the
  directory (**verified live**: `wf-live1-4` and `wf-live1-6` were removed).
- `ctx.vcs.status({location:{directory: worktree}})` **ignores the directory** and reports the
  plugin's own location, which is the main checkout. For that reason the runner detects changes
  with `git status --porcelain` plus a comparison of `rev-parse HEAD` against the value recorded at
  creation, run through `node:child_process` in the worktree directory. **Verified live**: the
  `wtdirty` agent created `hello.txt`, so the worktree was kept and reported through
  `onUpdate({worktree})`. `git status` there shows `?? hello.txt`.

## Tool context

`tctx = {sessionID, agent, messageID, id, progress, signal}`. `progress(metadata)` returns a Promise.

## Live verification recipe

```sh
S=$PWD/.sandbox
# own git project + committed loader (so worktrees load the plugin too)
cd $S/rproj   # git repo; .opencode/plugins/loader.js = export { default } from "<abs>/tests/e2e/spikes/runner-live.ts"
export XDG_DATA_HOME=$S/r-data XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$S/r-config XDG_STATE_HOME=$S/r-state XDG_CACHE_HOME=$S/r-cache
export SPIKE_LOG="$(cygpath -w $S/r-live.log)"
npx opencode2 run --standalone --auto --format json -m openai/gpt-5.4-mini "Call the rt_live tool with mode=all and then reply OK."
```

Setup notes:
- The loader must be a **static** re-export. A top-level-await dynamic `import()` in the loader
  never activated: the run hung until timeout with a `Transport` error.
- Now and then (1 run in 5) `opencode run` stalls at startup: the server logs "cli starting" and
  the plugin never loads. Re-running the same command worked.
- To inspect finished sessions, read `r-data/opencode/opencode.db` with `bun:sqlite`: tables
  `session_message` (`data` JSON) and `kv`.

Live results (2026-09-23): `plain`, `schema`, `effort`, `abort` (stopped after 3s, child
`outcome:"interrupted"`), `wtclean` (removed), `wtdirty` (kept), `wtschema` (cross-instance
submit), and `retry` all behaved as specified.

## Plugin install resolution

- **A sandbox inside a checkout of this package breaks package installs.** With `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
  under the repo, resolving `@rphang/opencode-workflows/server` from the (not yet existing) cache
  directory falls back to Node's package *self-reference* (the repo's own `package.json` has that name
  and `exports`), so opencode loads the checkout's `dist/` and never installs the published copy. Put
  a `package.json` with another name at the sandbox root. Also seen once on Windows: the install's
  staging-directory rename failed with `EPERM`; restarting the server retried it and it worked.

- A config entry `"plugins": ["file:///<dir>"]` (or a plain directory path, or
  `{"package": "file:///<dir>", "options": {...}}`) is resolved by `Host.resolve({directory})`
  (`@opencode/plugin/dist/host.js`), which tries `<dir>/server` then `<dir>/index` and **ignores
  package.json `main`/`exports`** *(source)*. Hence the repo's root `server.ts`. **Verified live**
  (`.sandbox/review/probe-install2.ts`, `opencode serve`): both directory forms load the plugin, and
  `options: {disabled: true}` reaches `setup` (plugin active, no workflow commands).
- A file target (`.../src/index.ts`) is rejected with `configured plugin path must be a directory`;
  the legacy `"plugin"` key and the tuple form `[url, options]` load nothing, silently.
- Loader files in a `plugins/` directory (`~/.config/opencode/plugins/`, `.opencode/plugins/`) always
  get `options: {}`.
